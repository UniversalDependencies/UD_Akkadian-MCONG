# Summary

UD_Akkadian-MCONG is a treebank of normalized Akkadian sentences drawn mostly from Neo-Assyrian corpora lemmatized on [Oracc](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/). Sentences are annotated for lemma, syntactic dependencies, and morphological features. The treebank contains approximately 112,000 words.

# Introduction

The bulk of the raw sentences underlying UD_Akkadian-MCONG were scraped from selected projects hosted on Oracc that came with lemmatization, POS tags, and in some instances paragraph divisions. An additional set of augmentation data consisting of about 250 normalized sentences made by the contributor were also added. The current list of Oracc projects making up UD_Akkadian-MCONG is given below, including an indication of approximately what percentage of the project's data is fully annotated and present in the treebank. For more details on these projects, consult the [Oracc project list](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/projectlist.html).
